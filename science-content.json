      "content": "# Recent Cannabis Research: 30 Days of Therapeutic Benefits and Emerging Risks\n\nRecent cannabis research highlights both potential therapeutic benefits and emerging risks: novel pharmacotherapies for cannabis use disorder are under review; high-THC products are linked to adverse mental health outcomes; preclinical studies confirm anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects; and medical cannabis may improve quality of life in cancer patients, albeit with methodological limitations in each study.\n\n## Emerging Pharmacological Strategies for Cannabis Use Disorder\n\n**Authors:** Lake et al.  \n**Year:** 2025  \n**Journal:** Expert Opinion on Emerging Drugs  \n**DOI:** 10.1080/14656566.2025.2558999\n\n**Summary:** This narrative review synthesizes recent meta-analyses and randomized trials of agents targeting endocannabinoid tone (e.g., FAAH inhibitors), motivational circuits (e.g., orexin receptor antagonists), and repurposed drugs (e.g., gabapentin, N-acetylcysteine). The authors conclude that, despite promising early-phase data, no pharmacotherapy has demonstrated robust efficacy for sustained recovery from cannabis use disorder (CUD).\n\n**Limitations:** Predominantly low-power or early-phase studies; heterogeneous outcome measures; lack of large Phase III trials.\n\n## High-Concentration THC Cannabis Products and Mental Health Outcomes\n\n**Authors:** Gruber et al.  \n**Year:** 2025  \n**Journal:** Annals of Internal Medicine  \n**DOI:** 10.1093/pm/pnaf110 (Aug 26 2025)\n\n**Summary:** Ninety-nine studies (n=221,097) of high-THC products (>10% THC or \"dab\" concentrates) were reviewed. Non-therapeutic studies reported consistent associations with increased risk of psychosis or schizophrenia (70%) and cannabis use disorder (75%). Therapeutic trials showed mixed effects on anxiety and depression, with approximately half reporting benefits but up to 30% noting adverse effects.\n\n**Limitations:** Majority of included studies had moderate–high bias; inconsistent product characterization; limited data on modern concentrate formulations.\n\n## Antinociceptive and Anti-inflammatory Activities of Cannabis sativa L.\n\n**Authors:** Martínez-González et al.  \n**Year:** 2025  \n**Journal:** Frontiers in Pharmacology  \n**DOI:** 10.3389/fphar.2025.1677987\n\n**Summary:** A crude ethanolic extract of Cannabis sativa aerial parts (1–10 mg/kg, oral) reduced writhing in the acetic acid test, decreased carrageenan-induced paw edema, and alleviated uterine contractions in dysmenorrhea models. Chemical analysis confirmed major cannabinoids (THC, CBD, CBG) plus flavonoids.\n\n**Limitations:** Preclinical rodent study; single extract batch; bioavailability and translation to humans unknown.\n\n## Medical Cannabis Impact on Cancer Patients' Quality of Life\n\n**Authors:** Silva et al.  \n**Year:** 2025  \n**Journal:** Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research  \n**DOI:** 10.1177/27683605251377417\n\n**Summary:** Sixteen studies (including four randomized trials) up to January 2025 were critically reviewed. Medical cannabis improved mental health, sleep, appetite, pain, and reduced nausea/vomiting in cancer patients, with mild–moderate adverse effects reported. Some studies noted increased survival and cognitive function.\n\n**Limitations:** Heterogeneous designs; small sample sizes; inability to perform meta-analysis due to variability; potential conflicts of interest with product manufacturers.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile recent research demonstrates both therapeutic promise and potential risks, the methodological limitations highlight the need for more rigorous, large-scale studies. This evidence base supports a cautious, evidence-based approach to cannabis regulation that prioritizes public health while allowing for therapeutic applications.",
